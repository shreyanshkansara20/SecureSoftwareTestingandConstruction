# Klee
Klee is a dynamic symbolic execution engine built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and available under the UIUC open source license. It's basically used for generating every possible test case for traversing through every branch of the code. One can even know that which set of inputs or which testcase is required to reach a specific branch of the code by using 'assert' in the program. This can be seen in various codes uploaded in this repository.

This repository also includes Klee Tutorials folder which can be used to set up the Klee on your system.
