# Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
SMT is a decision problem for logical formulas with respect to combinations to background theories expressed in classical first-order logic with equality. In layman's language, it is used for getting solutions for equations or mathematical problems. More importantly used to prove or disprove a mathematical theorem.
